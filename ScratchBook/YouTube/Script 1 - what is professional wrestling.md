## pro-wrestling history
professional wrestling as we know it started at ([Advent of the Angels: An Introduction to the History of Professional Wrestling – Eruditorum Press](https://www.eruditorumpress.com/blog/advent-of-the-angels-an-introduction-to-the-history-of-professional-wrestling))  



## Prompts 
 - i have decided to start an youtube channel. and the first video is about professional wrestling. after watching wrestlemania 40 i decided this. i am a nihilist and analytical philosophical guy. so my videos would be the same. i want discuss about what actually pro wrestling is. this absurd thing that humans do and enjoy. what manifested this?. write me the script for a 8 minute video

## Script
Here we are, on a wet rock circling a ball of fire in an infinite sea of nothingness. On this wet rock, by some miraculous coincidence, mud became alive and evolved into apes with  nuclear weapons and football and art and Big macs. And in this evolutionary sequence, these apes, for reasons only the god knows, put on tights and pretend to grapple each other in front of thousands of other apes, who, knowing it’s all a show, cheer on!

While watching Night 2 of this year’s WrestleMania, which, by the way, is the day I came up with this idea(wait till the end of the video), my uncle, only a few years older than me, noticed I was still awake at 5 AM watching wrestling. He sat beside me and asked the dreaded questions every pro wrestling fan faces: "You know it's fake, right?" "Does it hurt?" "Is he really beating him?" "Why do you even watch this?"

I mean, I sometimes ask myself the same questions, especially during wrestling's dark ages from 2016 to 2020. "What am I watching?" "What is this?" but today, after watching Cody Rhodes finally finish his story and seeing Roman's legendary reign end, I unironically ask myself again, "What is this?" "What am I watching?"
"What is Pro wrestling?? Anyway??"


Though pro-wrestling as we know it started at France. Originating from strong men circus acts. But if we open our mind and take a greater look we can see traces of an phenomenon throughout  history transcending cultures and civilizations  which will eventually become professional wrestling. As almost all the major cultures had their own version of the flood myth they also had their own version of pro-wrestling. 

The Pegentry 

The Prestige 

The pop?



whatever pro wrestling is, One of the best things about it is its interactivity. We the audience, the marks, the wwe universe whatever they call us  we take active part in the storytelling since.In my opinion Other than Video games pro wrestling is the most interactive art form out there! 


For this interactivity we pro wrestling fans have power unlike any other fandom to morph this beautiful art from into what we always knew it could become! . Help it reach its full potential! 
Also we wrestling fans as one of the most passionate and vocal fans on the planet deserve a platform of our own! A platform that caters to our unique needs that helps us to enjoy this unique art form even more!! 
Ladies and Gentleman this IS the idea i was talking about! I have been dreaming of making a platform for pro wrestling fans!! and Finaaaaaalllllllyyyy!!! I have started working on it!!!

ill posting weekly dev logs of the project in this youtube channel. so if you are excited and want follow or join the process please subscribe to this channel and if you enjoyed this video please leave it a like! Arigato!! Bye!
