Playing with the universe. What the universe does with sounds, sounds whichÂ are words, how Theirs a ripple in reality, emergence of the universe in ones hands. The sea of consciousness, coding the universe, changing it twisting it. Emotions, inventions, wisdom, revelations, Transcendence... Events, waves ripples. Everywhere, everything.
