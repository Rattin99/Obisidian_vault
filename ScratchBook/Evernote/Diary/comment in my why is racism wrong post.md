Racism exists for real reasons. Everyone is racist even if they don't know it. If you're walking home alone late at night (in the US) and you cross paths with a group of black guys and you get more scared than you would if it was a group of Asian guys. That's racism.

Here's where it gets real....Statistically speaking you ARE more likely to be mugged by a group of black men than any other race. SO...Yes racism is bullshit in most forms. Hating anyone because of the color of their skin is bullshit. BUT...in some ways it comes from reality.

We're originally from Chicago. Moved to Ohio when I was 14. My dad got into an argument with a guy he worked with's wife about racism. She'd never even been around anything but white people her whole entire life and swore that every race was the same and being prejudice was bullshit....welllllll....about a year later they moved to Charlotte NC. Massive black population. She'd been a waitress for like 20 years and loved it.

Within like 3 months she'd been spit on, screamed at, had drinks thrown on her, plates of food thrown on her, called a white bitch, a cracker bitch, and was almost physically attacked but the people the lady were with wouldn't let her get at her.

These are all separate events with different people btw. They moved back and she's now a full blown racist. absolutely hates blacks....People say "racism is a learned behavior". A lot of times it's taught by ignorant ass racist parents or peers...sometimes it's learned through experience.

Growing up a scrawny white kid in the south side of chicago it took me a LONG time to stop being racist. I wasn't taught to be racist, I learned it by getting the shit kicked out of me every time I left my yard. Being terrified every day walking to and from school... and we're talking at the age of 7-10. One time after about 6 teenagers beat the shit out of me (and stole my bag of chips i just bought) they dragged me onto the railroad tracks and left me there. If a train would've come I would've died because I didn't have the strength to roll off the tracks for at least 15 -20 minutes. I was fucking 9 years old! and all I did was walk to the gas station and be white. So yeah...It took quite a few years for the hate to wear off. It's also worth mentioning that my neighborhood was super diverse. Italians, Mexicans, Arabs, Indians, Koreans, etc...None of them messed with me.
