A reference to Heraclitus' philosophy that can be captured in just two words: “panta rei”, literally everything flows, meaning that everything is constantly changing, from the smallest grain of sand to the stars in the sky. Thus, every object ultimately is a figment of one’s imagination. Only change itself is real, constant and eternal flux, like the continuous flow of the river which always renews itself.
