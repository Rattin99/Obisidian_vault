What do you fear?

Are you terrified: do your hearts fail? Does the abyss here yawn for you? Does the hound of hell here yelp at you? Very well! Come on, you Higher Men! Only now does the mountain of mankind’s future labour.

God has died: now we desire that the Übermensch shall live!

\- Friedrich Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra.
