"Everything interests me, but nothing holds me"

It takes so little, so infinitely little, for a person to cross the border beyond which everything loses meaning: love, convictions, faith, history. Human life - and herein lies its secret - takes place in the immediate proximity of that border, even in direct contact with it; it is not miles away, but a fraction of an inch.

\- Milan Kundera, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting
