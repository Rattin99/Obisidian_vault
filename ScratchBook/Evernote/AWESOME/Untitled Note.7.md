PROPOSITION: Religion is the perfect stimulant for the animalistic mind.
REASONING: The evolutionary process is progressive and applies not only to physical attributes, but also the development of a thinking process that enables the animal to be aware of being aware. Human beings who remain attached to ancient superstitions and unevidenced belief systems based in magical thinking, could be said not to have evolved mentally, to the point of critical thinking, which is why there is so much conflict within and between different blind faith monotheistic religions. Although the image depicted relates to Islam, the same problem is found within Christianity between Catholics and Protestantâ€™s and of course there is also the even more bitter dispute between Islam and Christianity that continues to rage all over the globe. It should come as no surprise that animalistic acts are committed by animalistic minds and clearly the sedative aspect of religion, which includes the comfort blanket concerning life after death, is clearly not strong enough and simply dulls the mind.
CONCLUSION: Whether religion is the opium or the sedative of the masses, if we are to make evolutionary progress as a species the underlying problem is not going to be solved until we have created a vaccine within the scientific method of inquiry that will eradicate the disease for good.
