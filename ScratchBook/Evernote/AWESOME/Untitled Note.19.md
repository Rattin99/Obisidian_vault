1984, by George Orwell

“
Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.

Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.
If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human
In the face of pain there are no heroes.
One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship.
We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.
The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed.

Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you. Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.
