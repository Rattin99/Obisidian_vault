A Crafting RPG Puzzler
a puzzle game where we assemble meaning from the environment. player acts as the protagonists subconscious. One assembles the information form the environment according to ideas, philosophies and faith creating endless role playing possibilities. the game scene (mood, lighting, atmosphere) changes with the emotion of the protagonist.

the theories about human emotion from the article above made me come up with the idea of this game.
