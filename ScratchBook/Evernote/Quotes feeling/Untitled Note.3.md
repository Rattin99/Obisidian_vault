\->The Beast.
It must be the beast out there.
The obsidian cricket of our inevitable twilight singing our requiem.
Greg?
Can we please stop pretending we're gonna get home? 
Can we admit we're lost for good?
That this fog is deeper than we can ever understand?
That we are but wayward leaves, scattered to the air by an indifferent wind?
Can we just admit we are never gonna get home?
\->Star,Oh Star, up in the sky
Guide my dreams with light that shines.
Help me know just what to do
To get wirt home and also me, too.
And if you don't, i don’t care.
Ill pull down your underwear.
