I am nothing. I'll never be anything. I couldn't want to be something. Apart from that, I have in me all the dreams in the world.

We never love anyone. What we love is the idea we have of someone. It's our own concept—our own selves—that we love.

Everything is worthwhile if the soul is not small.

If you cannot live alone, you were born a slave.

Have you ever considered, beloved other, how invisible we are to each other? We look at each other without seeing. We listen to each other and hear only a voice inside out self. The words of others are mistakes of our hearing, shipwrecks of our understanding. How confidently we believe OUR meanings of other people's words.
