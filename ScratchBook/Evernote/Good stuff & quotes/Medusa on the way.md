And so, we are still here, still endowed with instincts and hormones, bound to play along: Unable to choose either hermitage or cemetery, we spend the day eating, shitting, working and keeping a straight face when, actually, the proper reaction to the whole hullabaloo might well be a hearty laugh. And yet, a spoilsport stopping on his way to work and wondering “Why do I even bother?” is labeled a deviant, at least a depressive. In earlier times, you might have been thrown into the workhouse; now you’re given medication which may make you run amok, thus solving several problems at once.
