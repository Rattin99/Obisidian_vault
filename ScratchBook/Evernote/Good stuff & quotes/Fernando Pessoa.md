[Life is what we make of it. Travel is the traveler. What we see isn't what we see but what we are.](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/453826)
\-fernando pessoa

The feelings that hurt most, the emotions that sting most, are those that are absurd - The longing for impossible things, precisely because they are impossible; nostalgia for what never was; the desire for what could have been; regret over not being someone else; dissatisfaction with the world’s existence. All these half-tones of the soul’s consciousness create in us a painful landscape, an eternal sunset of what we are.

I wasn’t meant for reality, but life came and found me.

There is a time when it is necessary to abandon the used clothes, which already have the shape of our body and to forget our paths, which takes us always to the same places. This is the time to cross the river: and if we don't dare to do it, we will have stayed, forever beneath ourselves

There are no norms. All people are exceptions to a rule that doesn’t exist.

Life is good, but Wine is better.
