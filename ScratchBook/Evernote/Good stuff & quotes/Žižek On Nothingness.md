Nothing 
Žižek: On Nothingness

That's all life is, it's this 'nothingness'. If you were to just do nothing but live, I am sure you would go mad. Because you have to do something, anything - it's impossible to just be alive. That's why we've invented all these fickle things to distract us. To distract us from life. We have to keep ourselves busy because we're all so in denial of the nothingness that goes on.
