i have become so ugly. i hate myself. i cant shake this feeling that we exist only once and this is what my existence is. i wish i was dumb enough to believe in a god or some other hinterworldly bullshit to cope with this. i believe in nothing.i thought i would be able to stare into the abyss without blinking but i can't. 
i just want the self control to work on the projects that i always wanted to. 
the pro wrestling app is on my mind all day. the youtube channel and short story book. i just don't know how to control myself and not be on youtube and facebook all day. fuuuuuuuuuuck
