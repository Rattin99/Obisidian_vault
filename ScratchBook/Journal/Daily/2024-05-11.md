well, been seeing vivid dreams for a while. this is how the mind copes i guess. today dreamt of being in the bernabeu and camp nou. funny thing is in the camp nou there were no seats and we had arrange seats for a lot of people. at the end of the dream i was crying hugging swapnil and maybe tanim. i was crying and saying that "mama spain e aste parlam, jibone bernabeu dekha hoilo".

job hunting is hopeless. dunno what to do.
